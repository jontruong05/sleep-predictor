# sleep-predictor

This Jupyter Notebook is a supplemental demo to the Intro to AI/ML Workshop hosted on 10/24/2024. It aims to create a simple linear regression model to predict sleep quality on a scale of 1-10 based on a number of factors.

For simplicity, it is best that the Jupyter Notebook is run on Google Colab and the dataset is downloaded locally to your computer. To open the notebook, go to File -> Open Notebook -> GitHub, and then paste this link into the GitHub URL: https://github.com/jontruong05/sleep-predictor

If you see errors at any point, try re-running the cells from the beginning.
